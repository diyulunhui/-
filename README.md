1.马踏棋盘可视化
2.Main和myframe类都可以直接运行，区别运行了就知道了
3.算法就写了个深度搜索，其实也写了贪心法，但是具体运行时没用，因为我跑的时候贪心法还没深度搜索跑的快，至于为啥我也不知道
因为是深度搜索，所以选点的位置直接影响算法跑出来的时间，（1，1）点我觉得跑的挺快的，其他点最多一分钟就能跑出来。
4.就是个课堂作业，希望南京邮电大学王海艳老师的学生就算找到我的代码也别抄
5.代码写的有点乱，见谅
6.有什么问题可以联系我,邮箱498900626@qq.com

1. Visualization of the horse board
2. Both Main and myframe classes can be run directly
3. The algorithm use deep search, actually also wrote the greedy method, but the specific run useless, because I ran when the greedy method has not run as fast as the deep search, as for why I do not know
Since it is a deep search, the location of the selected point directly affects the running time of the algorithm. I think the point (1,1) runs very fast, and other points can run out in a minute at most.
4. It is a class assignment. I hope students of wang haiyan of nanjing university of posts and telecommunications will not copy my code even if they find it
5. The code is a little messy, please forgive me
6. If you have any questions, please contact me at 498900626@qq.com
